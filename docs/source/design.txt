Design and History of Rtree
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design
..............................................................................

`Rtree`_ is a pure Python library that uses `ctypes`_ to wrap
`libspatialindex`_. It consists of two major classes -
:py:class:`rtree.index.Index` and :py:class:`rtree.index.Property` - and users
manipulate these classes to interact with the index.

Some short code examples should give you a quick overview of the design 
and behavior of Rtree.

Testing for Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  >>> from rtree import index
  >>> idx = index.Index()
  >>> left, bottom, right, top = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)
  >>> idx.insert(0, (left, bottom, right, top))
  >>> list(idx.intersection((1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0)))
  [0]
  >>> list(idx.intersection((1.0000001, 1.0000001, 2.0, 2.0)))
  []

This resembles a subset of the set protocol.
:py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.insert` indexes a new object by id,
:py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.intersection` returns an iterator over ids (or
objects) where the node containing the id intersects with the specified
bounding box. The :py:meth:`~rtree.index.Index.intersection` method is exact,
with no false positives and no missed data.

Finding Nearest Neighbors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following finds the 1 nearest item to the given bounds. If multiple items
are of equal distance to the bounds, both are returned::
  
  >>> idx.insert(1, (left, bottom, right, top))
  >>> list(idx.nearest((1.0000001, 1.0000001, 2.0, 2.0), 1))
  [0, 1]



History
..............................................................................

`Rtree`_ was started by `Sean Gillies`_ as a port of the `libspatialindex`_
linkages that `QGIS`_ maintained to provide on-the-fly indexing support for
GUI operations. A notable feature of `R-trees`_ is the ability to insert data
into the structure without the need for a global partitioning bounds, and this
drove Sean's adoption of this code. `Howard Butler`_ later picked up `Rtree`_
and added a number of features that `libspatialindex`_ provided including disk
serialization and bulk loading by writing a C API for `libspatialindex`_ and
re-writing `Rtree`_ as a `ctypes`_ wrapper to utilize this C API. `Brent
Pedersen`_ came along and added features to support alternative coordinate
ordering, augmentation of the pickle storage, and lots of documentation.
Mattias (http://dr-code.org) added support for custom storage backends to
support using `Rtree`_ as an indexing type in `ZODB`_.

`Rtree`_ has gone through a number of iterations, and at
0.5.0, it was completely refactored to use a new internal architecture (ctypes
+ a C API over `libspatialindex`_). This refactoring has resulted in a number
of new features and much more flexibility. See :ref:`changes` for more detail.

.. note::
    A significant bug in the 1.6.1+ `libspatialindex`_ C API was found where
    it was using unsigned integers for index entry IDs instead of signed
    integers. Because `Rtree`_ appeared to be the only significant user of the 
    C API at this time, it was corrected immediately.  You should update 
    immediately and re-insert data into new indexes if this is an important 
    consideration for your application.
    
Rtree 0.5.0 included a C library that is now the C API for libspatialindex and
is part of that source tree. The code bases are independent from each other
and can now evolve separately. Rtree is pure Python as of 0.6.0+.
